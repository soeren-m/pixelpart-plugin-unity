# Pixelpart for Unity

This repository contains the official Pixelpart plugin for Unity 2021.3+. The plugin allows you to play Pixelpart effects directly within the Unity engine, eliminating the need to export effects as sprite sheets or video files beforehand.

Once you've opened the project where you want to use Pixelpart, install the core package *net.pixelpart.tgz* using the Unity Package Manager. If your project utilizes the *Universal Rendering Pipeline (URP)* or the *High-Definition Rendering Pipeline (HDRP)*, make sure to additionally install the corresponding package: *net.pixelpart.urp.tgz* for URP or *net.pixelpart.hdrp.tgz* for HDRP.
