2. In the Unity Package Manager, click `+`, then `Install package by name...`.
3. Put *net.pixelpart.core* into the *Name* field and the exact required version of the plugin (e.g. *1.8.1*) into the *Version* field. Then, click `Install`.
4. If the project uses the Universal Rendering Pipeline (URP), additionally install the package *net.pixelpart.urp* in the same way. Make sure to add *net.pixelpart.urp* as a *Scope* in the Package Manager settings beforehand.
5. If the project uses the High-Definition Rendering Pipeline (HDRP), additionally install the package *net.pixelpart.hdrp* in the same way. Make sure to add *net.pixelpart.hdrp* as a *Scope* in the Package Manager settings beforehand.

1. Download the plugin from the Pixelpart website and extract the archive.
2. Start the Unity editor and open the project where you want to use Pixelpart.
